# My Web Projects Collection 🌐
This repository contains a collection of my front-end and asynchronous JavaScript projects. Each project is designed to improve my understanding of **DOM manipulation, event handling, API usage, promises, and async/await**. All projects are built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## DOM Projects
### Task 1: Dynamic To-Do List
* **Objective:** Learn element creation, event handling, and DOM updates.
* **Description:** Users can add, edit, and delete tasks dynamically. Tasks are persisted using `localStorage`.
* **Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Task 2: Live Character Counter
* **Objective:** Practice real-time DOM updates.
* **Description:** Displays remaining characters as the user types in a text area. Stops typing when the limit is reached and changes color based on character count.
* **Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Task 3: Image Carousel
* **Objective:** Timed DOM updates and manual navigation.
* **Description:** A slideshow of images with "Next" and "Previous" buttons. The slideshow automatically changes images every 3 seconds and pauses on hover.
* **Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Task 4: Form Validation App
* **Objective:** Implement DOM-based validation using events.
* **Description:** Registration form with live validation for Name, Email, and Password fields. Shows inline error messages and border color feedback.
* **Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Task 5: Interactive Product Filter
* **Objective:** Combine DOM manipulation with array iteration.
* **Description:** Filter products dynamically by category or search keyword. Supports buttons like "All", "Electronics", "Clothing".
* **Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Async JS Projects

### Task 1: Fetch and Display User Data
* **Objective:** Test API fetching using async/await and DOM rendering.
* **Description:** Fetches user data from JSONPlaceholder and displays it in a table. Includes a "Refresh" button and a loading spinner.
* **Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Task 2: Random Joke Generator
* **Objective:** Understand Promises and dynamic UI updates.
* **Description:** Fetches a random joke from an API. Includes a “Next Joke” button that fetches new jokes. Button disables while fetching to prevent multiple clicks.
* **Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Task 3: Weather Information App
* **Objective:** Combine API fetching with async functions and DOM updates.
* **Description:** Fetches real-time weather information for any city entered by the user. Displays temperature, humidity, and condition. Shows errors for invalid city names.
* **Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Task 4: Post Loader with Delayed Promise
* **Objective:** Simulate delayed data loading using Promises.
* **Description:** Loads a list of blog post titles after a 2-second delay. Shows a loading message while fetching data.
* **Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Task 6: Sequential Promise Execution
* **Objective:** Demonstrate Promise chaining and async flow.
* **Description:** Executes three sequential promises with a 1-second delay each. Highlights the current step in bold as it executes.
* **Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Task 7: Image Gallery Loader
* **Objective:** Learn asynchronous image loading.
* **Description:** Loads multiple images asynchronously and displays them as a gallery once all images are ready.
* **Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
